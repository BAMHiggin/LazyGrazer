MVP:
+ Insert list of ingredients and receive a list of optional recipes based on ingrediant list
+ Show optional youtube "how-to" videos on creating meals based on recipe name

Scope-expanding future ideas:



Necessaryproject items:
Two APIs needed
Must use AJAX
Must utilize one new library or technology not yet discussed
Must have a polished frontend / UI
Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
Must NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts (USE modals)
Must have some sort of repeating element (table,columns, etc)
Must use Bootstrap or Alternative CSS Framework 
Must Be Deployed
Must have User Input Validation (the field is required, this is not a valid email address, etc)


Nice-to-haves
Mobile responsive
Use an alternative framework like Materialize
Utilitze Firebase

Presentation Requirements
Explanation of overall concept
motivation for its development
design process
technologies you used (and briefly how they work)
A demonstration of its functionality
directions options for future development (laundry list of cool possibilities)

MVP (minimum viable product, kind of a proof of concept)

Metrics
Concept
Design
Functionality
Collaboration
Presentation (a unique pitch, powerpoint possibly?)

Suggestions
Stick to APIs that do all of the following:
Allows CORS (cross origins, look up)
Simple or no authentication
JSON response returned
Well documented
